# Prometheus Cardinality Exporter

A simple Prometheus exporter for exposing the cardinality of metrics Prometheus has scraped.

This was originally started as an intern project by [Harry Fallows](https://github.com/harryfallows) during his internship at [Thought Machine](https://thoughtmachine.net/).

## Design

This is a Prometheus exporter for exposing metrics related to the cardinality of metrics and labels scraped by other Prometheus instances.
The metrics are obtained by calling the Promtheus API at the ```/api/v1/status/tsdb``` endpoint ([docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/)).

## Metrics

There are 4 types of metric exposed:

```
1. cardinality_exporter_label_value_count_by_label_name{label=""}: These metrics report label names and their respective value counts.
2. cardinality_exporter_memory_in_bytes_by_label_name{label=""}: These metrics report label names and their respective memory used in bytes. Memory usage is calculated by adding the length of all values for a given label name.
3. cardinality_exporter_series_count_by_label_pair{label_pair=""}: This will provide a list of label value pairs and their series count.
4. cardinality_exporter_series_count_by_metric_name{metric=""}: These metrics report metric names and their respective series counts.
```
## Options

| -d        | --service_discovery | Use kubernetes service discovery instead of manually specifying Prometheus instances |
| -p        | --port             | Port on which to serve metrics                                                       |
| -f        | --freq             | Frequency in hours with which to query the Prometheus API                            |
| -r        | --regex            | If any found services donâ€™t match the regex, they are ignored                        |
| -a        | --auth             | Location of YAML file where Prometheus instance authorisation credentials can be found. For instances that don't appear in the file, it is assumed that no authorisation is required to access them. |
|           | --default_auth     | Default value of the 'Authorization' header when querying the Prometheus API. Leave blank for no default. |

## Exposing Metrics

### Dealing with Promeheus instances protected by authorisation
Some Prometheus instances will not let the exporter access the ```/api/v1/status/tsdb``` endpoint without providing some authorisation credentials. To access these instances, you must provide the authorisation credentials required. The solution to this depends on whether you are using the ```--proms``` or ```--service_discovery``` flag:
- With ```--proms```: use the ```--default_auth``` flag to specify the default Authorization header value and use the ```--auth``` flag to specify a YAML file mapping ```--proms``` instances to the values required (e.g. <my-prometheus>:<my-Authorization-header-value>)
- With ```--service_discovery```: 
	- Use the ```--default_auth``` flag to specify the default Authorization header value and use the ```--auth``` to specify a YAML file mapping instance identifiers to the values required. 
	- Identifiers can be at the namespace level, the prometheus instance level, or the sharded instance level. 
	- The naming convention is: <namespace>[_<prometheus-instance-name>[_<sharded-instance-name>]] (square brackets means optional). 
	- Example: my-namespace_my-prometheus-instance: "Basic 123456789". 
	- When looking for authorisation credentials, the exporter with look in this order:
		1. sharded instance level
		2. prometheus instance level
		3. namespace level
		4. ```--default_auth``` value
		5. nothing

### Installing on a cluster
See k8s/README.md for running on kubernetes

Docker images are available at thoughtmachine/prometheus-cardinality-exporter:$COMMIT
See  https://hub.docker.com/r/thoughtmachine/prometheus-cardinality-exporter

### Running Locally
```plz run //:prometheus-cardinality-exporter -- --port=<port-to-serve-on> --proms=<prometheus-instance-to-expose> [--proms=<prometheus-instance-to-expose>...] --freq=<frequency-to-ping-api>```

### Running Within a Kubernetes Cluster (with service discovery)
#### In order to deploy to a kubernetes cluster, run:
```plz run //k8s:k8s_push```
#### Make sure you alter the k8s/deployment.yaml such that it contains the options that you require:
```args: ["-c", "/home/app/prometheus-cardinality-exporter  --auth=<prometheus-api-auth-values-filepath> --default_auth=<default-prometheus-api-auth-value> --port=<port-to-serve-on> --service_discovery --freq=<frequency-to-ping-api> --selector=<service-selector> --regex=<regex-for-prometheus-instances> --namespaces=<namespace-of-prometheus-instances> [--namespaces=<namespace-of-prometheus-instances>...]]```

## Building
```plz build //...```

If you'd prefer to use docker to build and run all tests use

```docker build -f Dockerfile-builder . --rm=false```

## Testing
#### If you want to test any changes to cardinality/cardinality.go, you can run:
```plz run //cardinality:cardinality_test```
